There are two things that you need to focus on when doing FLL. The first part is **innovation**, which is a solution to address a problem in the world. For example, our innovation project is making a haptic suit that allows people to experience concerts and live sporting events from the comfort of their home.

The second part is **Robot Design**, which describes the parts of our robot.

### The Arm Attachment

The arm is an attachment that attaches to the front motor and can press things down or lift things up. We use it for:
- Immersive experience
- The lever on the rolling camera mission
- To push the rolling camera
- To push over our wall to do 3D cinema

### Sound Mixer Attachment

Another attachment we have is for the sound mixer. It has three pieces to push the sound mixer levers up. We also have a part on the side of it which picks up one of the experts.
